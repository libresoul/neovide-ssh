[Neovide](https://neovide.dev) is a Neovim GUI client which acts as a frontend for Neovim. This helper script allows you to run neovide on a remote machine over SSH, using local port forwarding. Also you can use it to open local directories.

This project is currently work in progress, and is not yet ready for day-to-day use.
